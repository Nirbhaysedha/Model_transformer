IN THIS I USED MANY FEATURE ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES FOR MY DATASET:-

COLUMN  TRANSFORMER   ( TO TRANSFORM WHOLE COLUMN USING APPROPRIATE TRANSFORMERS )
SIMPLE IMPUTER  :-  ( HANDLING MISSING VALUE IN MY DATASET )
ONE HOT ENCODER :-  ( ENCODING CATAGORICAL FEATURES )
FUNCTION TRANSFORMER :-
( I Got Skewed Data which is not Normally Distributed , So I applied Function Transformer To my Dataset and the Accuracy Got Increased )
